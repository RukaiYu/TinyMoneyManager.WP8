<!-- Example -->
<!--

    The preceding example demonstrates a hypothetical game called 'Contoso ROD3O!' which defines two
    Commands that a user can say to either start a new game or replay one of three levels in the game.  
    To initiate the PlayGame command, a user can say "Contoso Rodeo play  a new game" or "Contoso Rodeo
    play new game". Either phrase will start a new game. To initiate the second Command, a user can say
    "Contoso Rodeo replay level one", "Contoso Rodeo replay level two", or "Contoso Rodeo replay level 
    three".
    The second Command demonstrates how to use a PhraseList with a Command. PhraseLists can be updated 
    dynamically by the application (e.g., if a user unlocks a new level or game or feature, you might 
    want to allow the user to give commands for newfeatures after voice commands are already registered.)
    The third Command demonstrates how the {*} sequence can parallel another command to recognize speech
    that is not defined in the CommandSet.

  Note:

      [and] Indicates that "and" is optional. Making connecting words like this optional
            can help both "Contoso Rodeo, play new game" and "open Contoso Rodeo and play
            a new game" feel natural to speak.
                 
      {number} Defined separately from the Command, mapping to "one" or "two" or "three".
