By default, in main page, there are records from Today, and Income and Expenses Pivot List for specified year and month, grouped in Day. You can tap [choose month] to navigate to the data for one month.
In statistics page, three different kinds of charts are used to show the statistics summary for you.
In this version, 'accounts', 'categories' and 'E&I items' are related together, for each [delete] opreation on thoese objects, make sure it is valid for yourself.
[现金cash] account is build-in item, which is not for deleting by user.
By default, balance of each account is ￥0.00. The avaliable balance, can be updated by changing the [Initial Balance] property. (It's suggestion that is setup at first time the accoun is created.)
At the [Particulars] pivot, [Top] is income data, [bottom] is expense data.
In [App Settings-> Conversion Rate Manager], you can update that data.
The strategy of app updating is looping of big version update and hot-fix version update. Please backup your data by using [PC Client] or [Updating] in [AppSettings] page before each time getting big version update in [Marketplace].
The risk of unavailability data by incorrect [Currency Conversion Rate table], will be in the charge of user self. 
When [Send report], it will send all selected items from neither Income list or Expense list.
